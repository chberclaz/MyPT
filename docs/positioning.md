# MyPT — Project Positioning & Market Framing

**Status:** Frozen  
**Last updated:** January 2026

This document captures the current, canonical positioning of the MyPT project following the recent reframing discussions.  
It defines what MyPT is, who it is for, how it is priced, and the ethical principles behind these decisions.

---

## 1. What MyPT Is (Reframed)

**MyPT is an on-premise, fully offline, governed cognitive system that encloses a language model and controls its entire learning and inference lifecycle.**

Unlike typical “local LLM” solutions that focus primarily on inference, MyPT is designed around:

- lifecycle governance
- traceability and reproducibility
- explicit phase separation
- data sovereignty
- long-term ownership of AI behavior

The language model is a **component inside the system**, not the definition of the system itself.

MyPT provides an end-to-end pipeline to:

- construct, version, and govern datasets
- train models in explicit phases (pretraining, domain adaptation, grounded SFT, tool alignment)
- reproduce training runs deterministically
- trace model behavior back to data and training phases
- deploy and operate models fully offline and on-prem

MyPT turns probabilistic language models into **owned, auditable cognitive systems** without reliance on cloud services or opaque third-party pipelines.

---

## 2. Core Design Principles

The project is guided by a small set of non-negotiable principles:

- **Sovereignty over convenience**  
  Users own their models, data, and infrastructure.

- **Traceability over opacity**  
  Model behavior must be attributable to datasets, phases, and runs.

- **Governance over ad-hoc growth**  
  Capabilities are unlocked through deliberate phases, not shortcuts.

- **Offline-first by design**  
  No hidden dependencies, telemetry, or data exfiltration.

- **Sustainability and realism**  
  Bounded systems with honest resource usage instead of hyperscale abstraction.

---

## 3. The Two Target Markets

MyPT serves two distinct but complementary markets.  
They differ not by technology, but by **motivation**.

---

### 3.1 Niche Market: Regulated & Auditable AI

**Profile**
- Swiss / EU organizations in regulated environments
- Legal, finance, healthcare, infrastructure, public sector
- Internal departments with audit and compliance requirements

**Primary needs**
- On-prem / offline operation
- Traceability and reproducibility
- Dataset governance
- Clear accountability

**Buying behavior**
- Requirement-driven
- Formal and documented
- Slower but high-confidence decisions

This is a **small but explicit niche** with high willingness to pay.

---

### 3.2 Quiet Market: Sovereign AI Ownership

**Profile**
- KMUs, consultants, engineering firms, technically competent teams
- Privacy-, energy-, and independence-aware individuals and companies
- “Opt-out” users of Big Tech AI ecosystems

**Primary needs**
- Data sovereignty
- Independence from hyperscalers
- Full local control
- Long-term ownership over convenience

**Buying behavior**
- Founder- or owner-driven
- Fast once convinced
- Trust-based and values-aligned
- Low public visibility, high internal conviction

This is **not a niche market** — it is a **quiet one**.

---

## 4. Pricing Philosophy

MyPT is not priced like a SaaS or an API.

It is priced as:
- infrastructure
- capability ownership
- risk reduction
- long-term control

Pricing is **not per token, per user, or per usage**, but per system and per year.

The goal is:
- sustainability for a solo founder
- seriousness filtering for customers
- low operational stress
- honest value exchange

---

## 6. Ethical Positioning

MyPT explicitly rejects:
- opaque data sourcing
- silent data reuse
- hyperscale energy abstraction
- vendor lock-in as a business model

Instead, it promotes:
- transparency
- responsibility
- local control
- honest system boundaries

The **Sovereign tier** embodies this philosophy most directly, while higher tiers support organizations that require additional structure and guarantees.

---

## 7. Summary

MyPT is intentionally positioned at the intersection of:

- governed AI systems
- offline / on-prem deployment
- sovereignty and ownership
- long-term sustainability

It serves:
- a **niche market** driven by regulation and auditability
- a **quiet market** driven by values, trust, and independence

This positioning is deliberate, stable, and designed to scale calmly without compromising principles.
