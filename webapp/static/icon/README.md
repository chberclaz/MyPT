# MyPT Cyclops Icon Export Set

Included:
- `mypt-cyclops-dark.svg` / `mypt-cyclops-light.svg` (master SVGs, 64x64 viewBox)
- `dark/` and `light/` folders with size-specific SVGs:
  16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 512 px

Notes:
- All icons share the same `viewBox="0 0 64 64"` and only differ in width/height.
- You can safely use the master SVG and scale via CSS; the size-specific files are convenience exports.
